# AI-Driven MRI Upgrade Project

## Overview

This project aims to revolutionize MRI imaging technology by leveraging advanced AI techniques to enhance image quality, reduce scanning times, and lower costs. By upgrading MRI systems from 1.5T to 3T, we strive to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in healthcare settings.

## Welcome to Our Project!

### Our Motivation
MRI scans are expensive, and high-quality 3T models are even more so. Our goal here is a proof of concept to show that Artificial Intelligence-based image processing can increase access without the need for expensive technology. We believe this will increase access, especially for third-world countries where even keeping the lights on is a budgetary issue.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** Developed to provide superior image resolution and quality.
- **Efficient Image Processing:** A dedicated backend for handling image data, ensuring quick and reliable processing.
- **User-Friendly Frontend:** An intuitive UI that integrates seamlessly with backend services for enhanced user experience.
- **ML Parameter Testing:** Rigorous testing to optimize the machine learning model's performance.

## Team
