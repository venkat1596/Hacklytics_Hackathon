# Welcome to Our Project!

## Our Motivation
* MRI scans are expensive,and high quality 3T models, even more so. Our goal here is a proof of concept to show that Artificial Intellegence based image proccessing can increase access *without* the need for expensive technology
  * We believe this will increase access, especially for third world access where even keeping on the lights is a budgetery issue.
